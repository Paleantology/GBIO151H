# Homework One: Due March 6 at 5 pm.

First, download your homework. In your RStudio, enter:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dir.create("Homework")  
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Paleantology/GBIO153H/master/Homework/HomeworkFour.Rmd", destfile = "Homework/HomeworkOne.Rmd")
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BiologicalDataAnalysis2019/2019/master/data/surveys.csv", destfile="data/surveys.csv")
```

Your homework will now be located in a directory called `Homework`.


In your RStudio interface, you will note that there is now a "Homeworks" directory. In it, you will find "HomeworkOne.Rmd". In your RStudio instance, open it.

Each question will direct you to perform a task. Each question that expects code as an answer will have a space for you to enter the code. 

You are welcome, and even encouraged, to work with a partner. I do ask, though, that every member submits their own homework. To submit your homework, simply save it. I will see it.


## Question One - 1 point.

Load in the surveys.csv data file, and save it to a variable called "surveys".

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
#Enter your answer for Question 1 here
```

## Question Two - 1 point

Save the `hindfoot_length` column to its own variable, called `hindfoot_vector`.
```{r}
#Enter your answer for Question 3 here

```


## Question Three - 2 points

Calculate the mean of the `hindfoot_vector`. Does it work? 
```{r}
#Enter your answer for Question 4 here

```
In your own words, why did it not work? 


## Question Five - 1 point

Test your idea about why it didn't work by writing some code that will fix the problem.
```{r}
#Enter your answer for Question 5 here
# Hint: look at the function drop_na
```


## Question Six - 2 points

I have written some code to calculate the mean of the hindfoot. But it's not working! Correct my code. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
surveys <- read.csv("data/surveys.csv")
hindfoot_vector <- surveys[7]
hindfoot_mean <- (sum(hindfoot_vector)/length(hindfoot_vector))
```
