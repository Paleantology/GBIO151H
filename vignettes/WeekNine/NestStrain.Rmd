Today, we will be looking at the NextStrain [COVID-19](https://nextstrain.org/ncov) tracker. NextStrain is a website that uses genomes isolated from disease-bearing organisms to build phylogenetic trees. The trees can be used to assess patterns of transmission through time and space. 

1. How many genomes have been used to make this phylogeny?

2. Why are not all of the tips on this tree lined up? Why do some of them trunacte early?

3. How many independent transmissions have there been to the US?

4. Have there been transmissions from the US to other countries?

5. Where are the major sources of the Australian strains of COVID-19?
